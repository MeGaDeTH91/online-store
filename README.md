<h3><i>Title: </i><b>React Store</b> - great choice for your sales.</h3>

<i>Introduction: </i>
React store is simple solution for publishing, managing and selling your products with user-friendly UI.
The main goal is to make each seller's products available globally. The online store can be accessed as guest,
registered user with standard privileges and there is also administrative area.

<i>Technologies: </i>
The application consists two parts - back-end REST API, based on Express.js and front-end application,
based on the amazing React library.

<i>Launch settings: </i>
The REST API is located in the 'my-express-api' folder, navigate there with command prompt, powershell or
any other suitable command-line and execute 'npm start'. This will start the REST API on
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
Next, in the project root folder, in separate command-line window run the same 'npm start' command and
this will start the React app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
After that, is up to you :)
